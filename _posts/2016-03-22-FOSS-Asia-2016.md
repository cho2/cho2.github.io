On 18th-20th 2016, i attended [FOSS Asia 2016](http://2016.fossasia.org/). My talk on FOSS Asia was [**Contributing to FOSS with Inkscape**](http://www.slideshare.net/cho2marsmellow/contributing-to-foss-with-inkscape). It was really challenging that my time to present cutted from 10 minutes to 5 minutes.

Along with me, my friend, [Moko](https://www.facebook.com/sdmoko) also had a talk about FOSS in Indonesia Election.
