After read about [FUDCon APAC 2016 in Phnom Penh](https://fedoramagazine.org/chomreabsuor-phnom-penh-fudcon-apac-is-coming/), i decided to submit call for papers. I challenge myself to try building Maleo on Fedora. After build on Debian, Maleo also succesfully [build on openSUSE](https://gist.github.com/diorahman/6d9315a5bad51a5763f0). Based on this reference, i try to build Maleo on Fedora step by step.

So, here is the steps: [https://gist.github.com/cho2/bcf5874fb4385b8fe855ecdb6bff35d0](https://gist.github.com/cho2/bcf5874fb4385b8fe855ecdb6bff35d0)

Finally, Maleo running well on Fedora 24.
