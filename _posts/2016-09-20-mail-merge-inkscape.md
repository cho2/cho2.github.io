Sometimes we need mail merge on inkscape, usually to make id card or certificate in bulk. You need to install extension on Inkscape. Find the extension here : [http://wiki.colivre.net/Aurium/InkscapeGenerator](http://wiki.colivre.net/Aurium/InkscapeGenerator).

In `ink-generator` directory you will find two files, `generator.inx` and `generator.sh`. Just copy them files to `/usr/share/inkscape/extensions`. Then on Inkscape, this extension can be accessed from `Extensions` menu > `Misc` > `Generator`. Using this extension, you also need csv files containing list such as name or number or so on that will be using on mail merge.

Here is mail merge on inkscape tutorial i found on YouTube: [Mail Merge in Inkscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFKYOs3iKjE)
