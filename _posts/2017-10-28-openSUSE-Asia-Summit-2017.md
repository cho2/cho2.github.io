I already published a report about [openSUSE-ID on openSUSE Asia Summit 2017](https://opensuse.id/2017/10/28/opensuse-asia-summit-2017-sebuah-cerita-dari-tokyo/). Now it's my turn to write my experience. 

I arrived in Tokyo on Thursday morning, it was rainy from i landed in Haneda until i went to bed. It was autumn but the weather was very cold, about 10 degree Celcius.

Friday evening, it was a dinner with all speakers and local team. Then, the next day (Saturday), the conference started. [Takeyama-san](https://web.facebook.com/takeyamaf) opened the conference, followed keynote by [Richard Brown](https://github.com/sysrich) about Reintroduction of openSUSE.

After lunch break, i attended OBS workshop by [Alcho](https://github.com/alcho). I came late so that i dont quite understand about using OBS through `osc` command line. But i understand to use OBS through web UI.

Then, it's my talk about Flatpak and AppImage on openSUSE. I already published [my post about AppImage on openSUSE Asia Summit](http://blog.kukuh.syafaat.id/2017/about-AppImage-on-openSUSE-Asia-Summit-2017/) since their developer wrote an issue on my GitHub.
Right after me, it was [Andi Sugandi, also talked about build AppImage using OBS](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia17/program/proposal/1608). [Edwin Zakaria's talk](https://events.opensuse.org/conference/summitasia17/program/proposal/1572) also interesting since he told the audience about openSUSE Community in Indonesia.

The first day of conference closed by lightning talk. The first lightning talk was Youngbin Han from Ubuntu Korea. He talked about integrating Slack and IRC. The interesting one was Franklin Weng lightning talk about Becoming a TDF Member, he invited the audience to attending his talk in the next day.
