It was a post from Endless forum about [Endless Ambassadors program](https://community.endlessos.com/t/endless-is-launching-a-new-ambassadors-program/4042/), look interesting since Endless will be focusing on Ambassadors in Indonesia, also Endless just launched a series of computers in Indonesia with OEM partners (Acer and Asus). Endless OS also interesting for me because of Flatpak and OSTree. According to [Softpedia](http://news.softpedia.com/news/endless-os-is-first-linux-distro-to-enable-support-for-flatpak-apps-from-flathub-518002.shtml), Endless OS is the first Linux distribution to support Flatpak apps from Flathub by default, followed  by [Linux Mint on upcoming release of Linux Mint 18.3](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/10/linux-mint-18-3-adding-full-support-flatpak).

After apllied it, an email from Michael Hall came. Then i interviewed by Michael Hall and Nuritzi Sanchez on Google Hangouts. At the end of the interview, Nuritzi said that he will come to Indonesia. Surprised. After several days, an email from Michael came and said that i was chosen on Endless Ambassador Program.

Me with Cosimo

Four days after i arrived from openSUSE Asia Summit 2017 in Tokyo, Nuritzi and Michael invited brunch with an Ambassador from Jakarta (Jabodetabek i mean) and Endless Developer. I'm very surprised that Endless Developer came to Indonesia. It was nice to meet [Cosimo Cecchi](https://github.com/cosimoc) who also GNOME board, [Srdjan Grubor](https://github.com/sgnn7), [Robin Tafel](http://robintafel.com/), [Sam Spilsburry](https://github.com/smspillaz), Katie, Emmanuelle, Septira, and the others.
