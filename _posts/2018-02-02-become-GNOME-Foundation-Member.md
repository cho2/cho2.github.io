After waiting for a month, finally The GNOME Foundation Membership Committee approved me as GNOME Foundation Member. There are [11 people](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/foundation-list/2018-February/msg00001.html) who also approved as Foundation Members.

My next agenda is still [translating GNOME](https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/id/) into Indonesian. The next target is 100% for User Interface section on GNOME 3.28. Unfortunately, the Documentation section is still 20%. We need more effort to translating Documentation section.
