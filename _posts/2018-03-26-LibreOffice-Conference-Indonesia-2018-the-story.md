So here is a story from LibreOffice Conference Indonesia 2018 that i attended as committee, sponsor, exhibitor and backup speaker. 

## Day 0
Day 0 on Friday was workshop with [Andika Triwidada](https://i14i.andika.info), he is LibreOffice translator for Indonesian, i'm also work with him on [GNOME l10n](https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/id/). Accidentally, after Sholat Jumat and lunch break, he still had a meeting with PENS director. The another committee asked me to backup him as speaker on translation topic. Fortunately, i'm only spoke about 30 minutes, and he came back.

## Day 1
Day 1 was the first day of conference. The day before i prepared to spread 500 [Endless](https://endlessos.com/) DVDs and 400 [Endless](https://endlessos.com/) stickers into participant goody bag. That's my responsible as Endless Ambassador. I'm also sent five Endless Mini for doorprize one week before. Thanks to [Siska](https://twitter.com/halosiska) and [Sendy](https://twitter.com/sendyyeah) as other Endless Ambassador and GNOME team who prepared and handled GNOME and Endless booth, also Septira and Sam from [Endless](https://endlessos.com/). Day 0 i started with preparing [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) booth. We had many stickers from [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/) at the booth, also [The Special Edition of Linux Magazine](https://news.opensuse.org/2017/10/11/special-edition-highlights-opensuse-kde/).

## Day 2
Day 2 was the last day of conference. Beside stand by at openSUSE booth. I attended three talks. The first talk was "Monitoring SLA with Prometheus and LibreOffice Calc" by Didiet Agus Pambudiono from [Dicoding](https://www.dicoding.com/), [KLAS](https://klas.or.id/), and [openSUSE-ID](https://opensuse.id/). On this talk, he gave many gift as quiz to participant, i supported him with supplied some merchandise from openSUSE. The second talk was "SMK Sakti Goes Open Source" by Ananda Dwi Rahmawati. The last talk was "How To Contribute To Open Source Project As A Non-Coder?" by [Rizki Kelimutu](http://kelimuttu.github.io). It was interesting that i'm also non-coder, but i love to contribute to open source project.

# Epilog
I think i can claim that [LibreOffice Conference Indonesia 2018](https://libreoffice.id/) was the first and the biggest LibreOffice event in South East Asia nowadays, or Asia probably. So after met some people on this conference, we have some ideas and also good news, among others:

* When had dinner on day 2, i'm talked with Eric Sun also Franklin Weng. Eric said "See you on Taiwan this year", i heard before that GNOME Asia Summit and openSUSE Asia Summit will be in Taipei (?). Hope to meet you soon Eric. 

* When had dinner on day 1, me, [Andika](https://i14i.andika.info) and [Rizki](http://kelimuttu.github.io) had a small discussion about translation, Javanese locale, `jv_JV`, and the possibility of Translation Summit/Conference/Hackfest.

* [Siska](https://twitter.com/halosiska) will lead KLUWEK ( [Kelompok Linux Cewek Indonesia](http://archive.linux.or.id/node/2052) ).  

* The 11th edition of [BlankOn](https://www.blankonlinux.or.id/), codename Uluwatu, will released (if not postponed, again and again).

* The exhibitor probably will have booth again in iCrOSS 2018 on Spetember.

* Last but not least, [KDE Indonesia Telegram Group](https://t.me/kdeid).

I would like to say thank you to all commitee, sponsors, speakers, participant, exhibitor and all of you that supported this event.
