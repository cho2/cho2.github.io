This conference was special because it combined COSCUP, GNOME.Asia and openSUSE.Asia in one place. The conference was held in [NTUST](http://www-e.ntust.edu.tw/), Taipei City, Taiwan on August 11th-12th. The attendance numbers was 1364 people on day one and 784 on day two. For me, it's my second time for GNOME.Asia Summit and third time for openSUSE.Asia Summit. I gave two talks, one on [GNOME.Asia track](https://www.slideshare.net/cho2marsmellow/gnome-recipes-local-wisdom), one on [openSUSE.Asia Summit track](https://www.slideshare.net/cho2marsmellow/opensuse-leap-flatpak). We from Indonesia had a large number of people including from openSUSE, GNOME and LibreOffice-ID about 15 people.

## Day 1

Day 1 opened by openSUSE Board member (Ana and Simon), i missed this keynote. I was stand by on one of GNOME room on #301 because i'm taking care of GNOME slipers/sandals that i bring from Indonesia. "Supporting Miracast on the GNOME Desktop" by Benjamin Berg was my first talk that i attend. Then i attended "Desktop applications: life inside a sandbox" by David King, " The Year of the GNOME" by Nuritzi Sanchez and "Plan your testing" by Kat Gerasimova. Then i moved to openSUSE tracks, among them "Journey to openSUSE Leap 15.0" by Max Lin, and "How Jogja Become City of GNU/Linux User Friendly" by Estu Fardani. Day 1 closed with "The bright future of SUSE and openSUSE" by Ralf Flaxa (President of Engineering for SUSE). 

In the evening we had BoF sessions. First, i attended openSUSE BoF session because i'm presented about openSUSE.Asia Summit 2019 proposal. Then i attended GNOME BoF session although i'm late.

## Epilog

It was fun. Because i'm part of [GNOME foundation member](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/membership/) and [openSUSE member](https://connect.opensuse.org/pg/groups/111/opensuse-members/), combining two conferences that I part of them made easier for me to meet people from both of them even though I couldn't attend all the talks. 

What i expected there are GNOME booth with swag and conference t-shirt, but none of them.

Thank to Max Huang and team for awesome conference. Thanks to Franklin Weng and Eric Sun for dinner and ezgo t-shirt. Thanks to Nuritzi for GUADEC gift .ありがとうございました Ogasawara-san for Nikkei Linux Magz.
Special thanks to openSUSE for sponsoring my flight and GNOME Foundation for sponsoring my lodging.
