I was finishing the <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/languages/id/gnome-3-30/ui/">UI</a> translation for the next GNOME 3.30 release, unfortunately our coordinator, <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/users/andika/">Andika Triwidada</a>, quiet busy with <a href="https://www.asiangames2018.id/">Asian Games 2018</a> so that he can't reviewing and committing the translations. Then, today i becoming committer on <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/teams/id/">GNOME l10n Indonesia</a>, Andika promote me from reviewer to committer so i can help him to commit the translations.

I'll commit the UI translations and hope it will be ready for GNOME 3.29.92 (GNOME 3.30 RC). You can help us to reviewing the UI translation by downloading the <a href="https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/GNOME:/Medias/images/iso/?P=GNOME_Next*">GNOME Next iso from openSUSE</a> or <a href="https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/development/rawhide/Workstation/x86_64/iso/">Fedora Rawhide.</a>
