The story back to [2017](https://blog.kukuh.syafaat.id/2017/openSUSE-Asia-Summit-2017/) when I met Enoki-san from LibreOffice Japan and I ask about the possibility of creating LibreOffice Asia Summit or Conference. Finally, it happened in 2019 and I want to be part of its history.

It was my second time in Tokyo, Japan and it's great to be back here. Because the time of the conference was in Ramadhan, it was challenging for me. Unlike [JSConf EU 2019](https://2019.jsconf.eu/ramadan/) and [KubeCon CloudNativeCon Europe 2019](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2019/attend/ramadan/), there was no Ramadhan page for this time, but it's ok for me and Indonesian team since found a halal food and prayer room is a little bit easy. Because of Ramadhan, i stayed shorter than other Indonesia team. The Indonesian team consists of Ahmad Haris and Andik Nur Achmad as TDF members and Iwan Tahari and me as a speaker. The venue of LibreOffice Asia Conference 2019 was awesome, located in the greater of Tokyo, [Cybozu](https://cybozu.co.jp/) is on the 27th floor of Tokyo Nihombashi Tower.

The [LibreOffice Asia Conference 2019](https://conf.libreoffice.jp/program.html) held in two days. Day one started with Mark Hung keynote "LibreOffice CJK Bugs, Fixes, and Stories". Then I attended Wen-Ke Huang "Grow out of nothing, the first successful experience about importing LibreOffice into state-owned company (CPC corporation, Taiwan) since 2016". Followed by Linjie Lv "LibreOffice: Educational practice in China". After the break, then my turn to talk about [LibreOffice Flatpak, Snap and AppImage](https://github.com/cho2/slides/tree/master/LibreOffice-Asia-Conference-2019). Iwan S. Tahari as a sponsor talks about "Our Seven Years Experience Running LibreOffice At FANS Shoes Manufacture". After the second break, Tomaž Vajngerl from Collabora talks about "Collabora Online and what is new in latest version – 4.0". The first day closed by Italo Vignoli & Lothar Becker keynote "LibreOffice, the many different faces of a global community". It's an honor that Italo mentioned about Indonesian LibreOffice Community for their hard work.

The second day only focuses on Business Workshop / ビジネスワークショップ, Certification interviews / 認定面接, and CJK HackFest. I only attended the first business workshop with Italo and Lothar. Actually, it just like a discussion and sharing session about, for example, LibreOffice migration. Mostly, Italo and Lothar tell about their experience in Italy, Germany, and Europe.

Last but not least, i would like to say thank you to The Document Foundation, LibreOffice Japan (Naruhiko-san and Enoki-san), Iwan Tahari from FANS, and the LibreOffice-ID team also [Fadlun AKbar](https://github.com/alunux) who also [KLiM](https://www.klim.or.id/) member and now work in Japan. See you in the next conference.
