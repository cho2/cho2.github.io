# Day 0

Day 0, there was l10n workshop with Andika Triwidada (l10n ID Coordinator). There was only a small number of people that attend this workshop. One thing that interesting, there was one participant from overseas that attends this workshop, he is [Khairul Aizat Kamarudzzaman](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/fenris) from Malaysia. He is also a Ubuntu member. We discussed GNOME translation workflow, tips, and tricks.

# Day 1

I started with manage openSUSE booth because openSUSE also sponsoring GNOME.Asia this year. I only attend one talk, presented by Rahman Yusri Aftian. He talked about Pegon at GNOME. You can read more about Pegon [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegon_script).
I also gave lightning talk about GNOME l10n Indonesia Progress. I reported about the progress of Indonesian that achieves 100% on UI translation. I also invite a newcomer to join the translation team because next GNOME 3.36 code name will be “Gresik” (?)

# Day 2
On day 2, I attend Darian Rizaludin talk from KLAS (Kelompok Linux Arek Suroboyo/Surabaya Linux User Group). He talked about “The experience of the KLAS roadshow to ignite the spirit of Open Source in East Java, Indonesia”. Kudos to Darian and KLAS that always help and support us in the community. The next talk, “Current State of BlankOn Linux Development” by Samsul Maarif from BlankOn and KLIM (Komunitas Linux Arek Malam/Malang Linux User Group). Just like nostalgic when we discuss about BlankOn. I was part of them. I also attend the last few parts of “F/LOSS for Education” by Sokibi Imgos. He talked about Gcompris also.
Before closing, there was a lightning talk. Suddenly, Khairul’s lightning talk about GNOME.Asia 2020 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia was interesting. I think it’s good news to engage more South East Asia FOSS Community.

# Epilog
I don't expect too much for GNOME.Asia this year. Yes, because there are a number of events held close together. Some of the people behind them are the same. Big appreciate for the organizer because I know they don't have much time to prepare it. Thank you to GNOME Foundation for sponsoring my travel and see you on the GNOME.Asia Summit 2020 in KL.
