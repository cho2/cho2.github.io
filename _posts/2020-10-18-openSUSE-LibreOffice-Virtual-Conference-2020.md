openSUSE + LibreOffice Virtual Conference 2020 started on October 15 2020. Opened by Lothar Becker (TDF Chairman). Due to some problem in platform (https://oslo.gonogo.live), the organizer moved all sessions to Jitsi on TDF infastructure (https://jitsi.documentfoundation.org). 

I presented ["Building Upstream Contribution in Local FOSS Community"](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO/program/proposals/3172) on day 2 (October 16, 2020). You can find the slide [here](https://blog.kukuh.syafaat.id/slides/oSLO-2020/oSLO-kukuh_syafaat.pdf). It was interesting that before my talk, there are three talks from the Asian side that strengthen the Asian community.
- [The challenge of growing the LibreOffice Japanese community through events under COVID-19](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO/program/proposals/3238) by Shinji Enoki from Japan
- [Building LibreOffice Korean Community and CJK's common & different issues](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO/program/proposals/3154) by DaeHyun Sung from South Korea
- [Working with native/indigenous communities to build native language LibreOffice projects](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSLO/program/proposals/3349) by Kuan-Ting Lin and Wang Larry from Taiwan


Actually, at this conference, openSUSE-ID help to live streaming some sessions because some people in Indonesia had a problem when connected to Jitsi. Though it ended with an internet connection problem in live streaming (and perhaps timezone, we are in UTC+7 so we can't live streaming all sessions), it really helps. Here are the lists:

Thank you to all people who make this conference happened. 
Personally, I hope that pandemic will end soon so that we can meet in person at the next conference.
